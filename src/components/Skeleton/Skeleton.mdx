- Default minimum dimensions prevent layout collapse during loading
- Fully customizable through Tailwind CSS classes for width, height, and border radius
- Animation runs continuously at 1.5s intervals with smooth linear timing
- Background uses neutral surface colors that adapt to theme variations
- No JavaScript required - pure CSS animation for optimal performance
- Combine multiple skeletons to create complex loading layouts that match your content structure
