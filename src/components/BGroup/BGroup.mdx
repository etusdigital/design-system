# BGroup

This component is used to group other components into distinctively selectable groups of inputs, or to just visually group them in case they are not inputs. The most common use case is for grouping radio buttons.

The model value will contain the currently selected component's **group-value** prop. You can use the model value of the **BGroup** component or the model value of the individual components themselves to either read or set the currently selected value, meaning that when you update the model value of an individual component, it will update the **BGroup**'s model value aswell and vice-versa.
